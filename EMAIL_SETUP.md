- hotel@greekdancefestival.gr → forward to giannisaliev@gmail.com

This way you receive all emails in one place.

### Update Website Contact Info
The website is already configured to use:
- `info@greekdancefestival.gr` - General contact
- `hotel@greekdancefestival.gr` - Hotel bookings

Make sure these emails are active before the site goes live!

## Recommended Setup:
**Use Google Workspace** for professional appearance and reliability, especially for a business/festival website. The cost is worth it for the professional image and features.
